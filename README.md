# Getting Started with Solidity

Solidity token app with GOAT as symbol 
#Compile files using "truffle compile"
#Test using "truffle test"
Code compiles fine but the 13th test fails due to "Reference Error" in beforeEach hook.
Behaviour deemed peculiar as "token" itself is referred to severally in file.
Correspondence/feedback appreciated
